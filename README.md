## General info
This project is a Towers of Hanoi terminal game I created after learning how to implement stacks in python. 

Prior to creating this project, I reestablished my understanding of nodes, linked lists, queues, and stacks; learned how implementing them in code works, gained a deeper understanding of the logic of a stack in programmingand using a multiple of them simultaneously, and worked a bit on my logical thinking. Alongside the fundamental aspects of the game, I also relearded importing classes from local files!
